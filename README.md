# NumbersToPagesMM
A small and simple example of grabbing data from Numbers and exporting it to Pages for a mail merge esque operation. It was initially created to solve a problem for a family member. There's still a lot of work to be done -- see the TODO at the top of ViewController.m. Please contribute!


## If you came here from Google hoping for a Pages mail merge program...

You're probably going to be disappointed. This repo isn't anywhere near a fully fledged mail merge program (although it'd be awesome if it eventually was!). If you're a programmer though, you might be able to use this as a starting point to solve your own mail merge issues!
